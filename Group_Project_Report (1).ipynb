        "Potable water (water that is safe to drink) is a basic requirement for human life. Lack of access to potable water is an issue that continues to affect many regions globally. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 is accordingly: \"Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”. According to the most recent 2020 report from the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 26% of the global population (1.97 billion individuals) did not have access to safely managed drinking water services (1). Researching sufficiently fast, reliable, and cost-effective ways of evaluating the safety of drinking water is crucial to addressing this issue. In 2016, UNICEF called for the production of rapid-test kits for detecting the bacterium *Escherichia coli* (usually present in fecally contaminated water) (https://www.unicef.org/innovation/rapid-water-quality-testing). Apart from microbes, various other factors affect water potability. For example, trihalomethanes are a type of disinfection by-products produced during some water treatment processes, and have been demonstrated to be carcinogenic to humans (2).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, we will utilize a synthetically generated dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability) containing over 3000 observations, each representing a sample of water. Each observation contains nine variables that affect water potability (pH, hardness, total dissolved solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity) as well as a score indicating whether or not the water is potable. Using this dataset, we aim to demonstrate how a classification model can be trained to accurately evaluate whether or not an unknown sample of water is potable based on measurable variables."

Lack of access to potable water is an ever-growing issue that continues to affect many regions globally. Using a classification model generated similarly to what we have done, we can recognize which water bodies are safe to drink based on their chemical and physical properties such as pH, conductivity, sulfate content, and what causes the variability in the potability. While our analysis was restricted to nine predictors (pH, hardness, total dissolved solids, chloramines, sulfate, conductivity, organic carbon, trihalomethanes, and turbidity), there are many other predictors which can and should be utilized for better classification. Future research could be done to determine which predictors are most analytically valuable and economically feasible. The impact of certain predictors will likely vary between the geographical region and should be well-researched before implementing any model in real-world use."
